This is a simple example project using the [Electron Builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-guru/electron-builder) which allows the Angular CLI to be used for
developing Electron applications.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run `npm run electron` to start the dev server and open Electron.
